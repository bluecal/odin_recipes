        <h3> Description </h3>
            <p> These are everything you could want from classic pancakes: light and fluffy with crispy edges, 
                perfect for soaking up pools of melted butter and maple syrup alongside your plate of oven-baked bacon and our creamiest scrambled eggs. </p>
            <p> Made from a simple batter of flour, milk, eggs, and baking powder, thereâ€™s a reason these are a favorite amongst the Delish team. </p>
        <H3> Ingredients</H3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 1/2 c. (180 g.) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li> 1 tbsp. granulated sugar </li>
                <li> 2 tsp. baking powder </li>
                <li> 1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 1/3 c. whole milk</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 tbsp. melted unsalted butter, plus more, softened, for cooking and serving</li> 
                <li>Maple syrup, for serving</li>

            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, 
                    whisk milk, egg, and vanilla. While whisking, stream in melted butter and whisk to combine.</li>
                <li> Gently fold dry ingredients into milk mixture until just combined (do not overmix; some lumps are okay). </li>
                <li>Preheat a griddle or other large heavy skillet over medium heat until hot but not scorching, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Melt enough butter to cover surface of griddle, then pour about 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. 
                    Cook pancake until bubbles form on top and sides start to lift from pan, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                    Flip and cook until bottom is golden brown and pancake is fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                    Transfer to a wire rack. Wipe off griddle, then repeat with more butter and remaining batter (you should get about 10 pancakes).</li>
                <li>Divide pancakes among plates. Serve with butter and syrup.</li>
            </ol>
